Finish of the stats table:
    displaying lethality and armour pen seperatley (magic pen, lifesteal) armour pen and crit and stuff check comment is stored as %

    also how to neatly allow me to easily add items to these calcuations and runes (store i guess)
        - add items to the store
        - calculate one item stuff
        - do it for all

    

start thinking about rune/masteries


Keep in mind:

- simpleItemDesc can be null

- some items are attack_damage and others attackDamage

- check your github page for reply to marik data shit

Notes:

- went from store based to query param baseed to share builds etc.

- use item description from riot games

    attack speed calc
    crit being %
    displaying lethality and armour pen seperatley (magic pen, lifesteal) armour pen is stored as %

    also how to neatly allow me to easily add items to these calcuations and runes

start thinking about the item picker and rune/masteries

rewrite seperate way to calculate stats

trying to install pinia

Notes:

- went from store based to query param baseed to share builds etc.

- use item description from riot games

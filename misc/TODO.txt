Finish of the stats table:
    ALSO Movespeed can have %

    Mythic passives like kraken slayer

    Search bar is not isVisible

    healthREgen and manaRegen for items, moveSpeed can have % (and has it's own calculation)

    Abilities


- 
- Figure out if vscode formatting fucks with your data

    




Keep in mind:

- JHIN attack speed doesn't work (his ratio is 0 makes sense)

- % movespeed values ignored, too much effort to calculate

- Graves is different ingame cause reloading, volibear/ekko works i guess 

- simpleItemDesc can be null

- check your github page for reply to marik data shit

- Bonus attack damage may be a decimal and stuff

- for runes had to add adaptive_type




Notes:

- went from store based to query param baseed to share builds etc.

- use item description from riot games

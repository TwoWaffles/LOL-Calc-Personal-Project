remove useless items with rank minion and turret etc.

figure out tooltips, use videos or something


Finish of the stats table:
    crit being %
    displaying lethality and armour pen seperatley (magic pen, lifesteal) armour pen is stored as %

    also how to neatly allow me to easily add items to these calcuations and runes (store i guess)

start thinking about rune/masteries




Keep in mind:

- simpleItemDesc can be null

Notes:

- went from store based to query param baseed to share builds etc.

- use item description from riot games
